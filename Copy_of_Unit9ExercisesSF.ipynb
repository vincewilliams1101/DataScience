In the first stage each peice of data is assigned a weight, meaning how important is that peice of data. Then after testing, the weight matrix is updated to reflect the actual importance of each peice of data and then the matrix multiplication is done again. This equation y = W * X + b is done many times to find the right weights for each peice of data."
